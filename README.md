## MOYRA (Multi bOdy dYnamics fRAmework)

With this library you can create symbolic equations of motion for low-order multi body systems. These systems can then be converted into numerical equations to be intergrated in either python or MATLAB.

## Double Pendulum Example

In this section we will derive the equations of motion for a double pendulum.
